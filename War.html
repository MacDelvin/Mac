<p style="color: blueviolet;font-size: 30px"><i>He was one of the most <mark>decorated </mark>American combat soldiers of World War II. Murphy first was denied from all military branches for being under aged and underweight. So he had his sister falsify his birth date and he was accepted by the U.S. Army. He received every combat award of valor available from the U.S. Army and he also received the French and Belgian awards of heroism.

The first Medal of Honor he received at the young age of 19 is he single handedly held off an entire company of German soldiers for an hour. Then once help arrived he led a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition.</i>  </p>

He had a musket that was trimmed to fit his size so he was able to defend in battle.
